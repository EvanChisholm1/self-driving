# Self Driving Simulator

This is a playground for me to experiment with neural networks and reinforcement learning. I will experiment with different RL methods and types of self driving environments starting with a simple network and game where you simply have to follow a track, not even real 3d inputs.

## Todo

-   [x] add acceleration physics
-   [x] add track
-   [ ] add logic to tell if car is on track
-   [ ] add actual car image
-   [ ] figure out neural network architechure, inputs and outputs
-   [ ] train network
-   [ ] test
-   [ ] add track editor
-   [ ] 3d evironment
